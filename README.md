The possible association between levels of pollution, weather, income, and mortality in 60 US cities were analysed using R.
- Exploratory data analysis was carried out to identify possible data transformations and correlations between variables
- A linear regression model was fitted to predict the likely impact on mortality of a reduction of both Nox and Sox levels to 40 for a particular city
- A statistical report was generated and outputted via HTML
